# 🚚 Designing a Machine Learning Vision System for Axle Installation  
*In progress*

This project is in collaboration with Daimler Trucks to reduce axle misalignment during assembly. In the factory, axles are installed onto a flipped truck chassis, where small lateral or angular errors can lead to costly rework later in production. Our goal is to detect these misalignments within allowed tolerances so corrections can be made early on the line.

## 📷 Camera Selection
- Performed optics calculations and trade studies to select an industrial camera meeting accuracy and coverage requirements  
- Selected a 5 MP Imaging Source camera, targeting approximately 1 mm accuracy with a 3 m by 2 m field of view at a 3 m mounting height  

## 🧠 Computer Vision System
- Developing a segmentation-based vision pipeline to detect the chassis and axle  
- Computing axle centerline and chassis reference features to estimate lateral offset and angle error  
- Displaying real-time measurements in an operator-facing application to guide installation  

## ✅ Impact
- Reduces rework and assembly downtime by catching misalignment early  
- Improves build quality and lowers the risk of misaligned axles leaving the factory
